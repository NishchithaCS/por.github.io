    <h2>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">This Python-based driver drowsiness detection project utilizes image processing techniques to monitor facial features and eye movements, issuing alerts upon detecting signs of fatigue. By analyzing blink rates and facial expressions, it enhances road safety without relying on artificial intelligence, offering a lightweight solution for preventing accidents due to drowsy driving. The system's non-AI approach ensures simplicity and efficiency, making it accessible for integration into various vehicle safety systems. Through continuous optimization, it aims to provide reliable drowsiness detection without the need for complex AI algorithms.</p>
    <h3>Technology Used:</h3>  
    <p style="font-size: large;">Python</p>

<h2>Face Recognition Based Attendance System</h2>
<p style="font-size: large;">This project leverages Python's face recognition libraries to automate student attendance, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. A camera with medium resolution is positioned at the entry point to capture student faces, which are then matched against a database for attendance marking. By eliminating manual processes, it minimizes the potential for proxy attendance and streamlines administrative tasks. The system ensures real-time attendance tracking, providing a modernized solution for educational institutions. Through the integration of facial recognition technology, it offers a robust and reliable approach to attendance management.</p>
